# cube

## Description
Cube is an AI and mathematical computational engine. The goal of this project is to create a software base that can be implemented into other existing systems. The engine will also come with tools that explain and diagnose the mathematical concepts which can also be implemented into other existing software. It is also being designed where computational speed is key.
